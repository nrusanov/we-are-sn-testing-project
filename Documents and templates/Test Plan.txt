### 4. **TESTING STRATEGY**

The strategy for testing the sofware product aims at equivalent distribution of taks between team members.
The team members will divide functionalities into test suites and every member will be responsible for 
his/her test cases writing and execution.  
Every test delivarable will be committed to GitLab repository and a merge request link will be provided, so
the other member would be able to check the delivarable / or each team member will discuss with the other
the delivarable before committing to GitLab.
The team will have daily communication via Microsoft Teams and will held a weekly meeting about progress.
Occasional meetings are also possible regarding changes in deadlines and test schedule. 


- **Testing tools**:  
    - IntelliJ IDEA;
    - Selenium Webdriver;   
    - Postman;   
    - GitLab;   

- **Unit testing** - Unit testing is already performed by the development team and is considered done;  
- **System and Integration Testing** - System and Integration testing are part of the testing team engagement. 
The following types of testing will be performed:  
     - Functional testing - Functional testing is performed using the functional specification provided by 
the client and verifies the system against the functional requirements;
     - Exploratory testing - will be executed covering the Public part and Private part. 
The Exploratory testing session will be between 60 and 90 minutes. The testing process will be documented 
and the occurred issues will be reported;
     - Smoke testing - The purpose of the smoke testing is to ensure that the critical functionalities 
of the application are working fine;
     - Usability testing - The goal of usability testing is to reveal areas of confusion and uncover 
opportunities to improve the overall user experience;
     - Regression testing - The purpose of regression testing is to ensure that the code changes adversely 
not affect the existing functionality;
-**Acceptance testing**- The purpose of this test is to evaluate the system's compliance with the business
